# JS Calculator

This is a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations. This is the final project for the Web Development 101 section of The Odin Project. 

## Goal

The goal for this assignment was to create a calculator that runs in the browser and can perform simple calculations. The calculator should be able to take multiple operations as input, but will return the result as calculated from left-to-right, not in the order of operations.

## Extras

Some of the stretch goals for this project were to add styles, implement a backspace button, and build out keyboard functionality, which I've done. The DEL button will remove the right-most digit from the screen, even from the result of running a calculation. I use keycodes for multiple keys to make sure users on different layout keyboards are able to use the keys they have to work with the calculator, even without a numpad.

## Reflection

This project definitely challenged me the most of all the projects worked on throughout the Web Development 101 curriculum. I enjoyed the challenging portions of this project that forced me to research and find better ways to implement my calculator so it worked as expected.
